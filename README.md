Joeleen Kennedy's React playground

I debated whether to set this up as a project site, but the current plan is that this will eventually be my new portfolio site, so I chose to set it up as my user site for now.

For a user site, GitHub Pages requires that the content being served is on the master branch, so this branch holds the build files and will have auto-generated commits with terrible commit messages. 

To see the React App source code, check out the [react-app branch](https://github.com/joeleenk/joeleenk.github.io/tree/react-app).
